Key points:- keep in mind while playing. 

The game chooses a secret word from a list of words.

The player guesses one letter at a time.

If the letter is in the word, it is shown in the correct place.

If the letter is not in the word, the player loses one chance.

The player has 6 chances to guess wrong.

The game ends when the player guesses the full word or uses all 6 chances.
